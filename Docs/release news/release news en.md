The release date is officially set.
YUME ROOF launches on Steam on February 18, 2026.

Base price is $7.99 USD.
At launch, we’ll run a 40% launch discount.

Thank you so much to everyone who supported us along the way.
This is our very first game, and we’re truly grateful to finally share it with you.

YUME ROOF is a slow-life sandbox where you build your own cozy place on top of a Japanese urban rooftop.

No management stress, no combat, no “correct” way to play.
Just a rooftop, passing time, and the occasional cats who come to visit.

When life gets noisy, take a quiet break above the city.
From morning to night, decorate at your own pace and simply enjoy being there.

Supported languages:
English / 日本語 / 简体中文 / 繁體中文 / Français / Deutsch / Italiano / Português / Español / 한국어 / Русский

Please wishlist YUME ROOF and follow the Steam page for launch updates.
See you on the rooftop on February 18, 2026.
