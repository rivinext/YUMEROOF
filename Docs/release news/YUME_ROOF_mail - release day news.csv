body,"YUME ROOF is officially out now on Steam.

After developing this game solo, the rooftop is finally open.

Inspired by the cozy freedom of games like Animal Crossing, YUME ROOF offers a quiet sandbox experience set on a Japanese apartment rooftop — without objectives, enemies, or time limits.

You can freely place furniture and plants (no grid), change the time of day, and slowly shape the atmosphere however you like.

Watch sunlight spill across the floor.
Let plants sway in the wind.
Sometimes, a cat will casually walk by.

There is no right way to build.
No perfect layout.
Just your rooftop.

Launch discount (40% off) is now live.

If you’ve been waiting, this is the perfect time to step onto the rooftop.

Thank you to everyone who supported the demo and added the game to their wishlist.
I truly hope you enjoy your time there.",,,,,,,,,,
